## Commits
1. Stage the file. `git add <your-file>` that has changed. e.g `git add frontend/index.html` because I made changes to the *index.html* file in the frontend folder. You can use *vscode* or *github Desktop*.
2. Write an explanatory commit message using `git commit -m "<your-message>"` e.g `git commit -m "link style.css file"`.
