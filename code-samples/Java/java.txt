Title: Java Authentication code 

Ref: https://github.com/Kloudless/kloudless-java

Introduction: 
The Kloudless Authentication Java Sample Code demonstrates how to use a bearer token authentication. The getting started guide includes Out-of-band OAuth Flow and 3-Legged OAuth Flow.


Code sample :

@Controller
get("/", (request, response) -> {
    Map<String, String> urlAndState = Application.getAuthorizationUrl(
            "YOUR APP ID",
            "http://YOUR DOMAIN NAME/callback",
            "Scope");
    App.currentState = urlAndState.get("state");
    response.redirect(urlAndState.get("url"));
    return "";
});
