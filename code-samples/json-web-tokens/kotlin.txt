Title: Lock.Android: Refresh JSON Web Tokens

Ref: https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock-android/lock-android-refresh-jwt

Introduction: When authentication is performed with the offline_access scope included, a Refresh Token is returned with the credentials. This value can be used to request a new Access Token and avoid asking the user their credentials again.

Code Samples:

val refreshToken: String = // Retrieve Refresh Token from secure storage
val account = Auth0(this)

val client = AuthenticationAPIClient(account)
client.renewAuth(refreshToken)
  .start(object: Callback<Credentials, AuthenticationException> {
  override fun onFailure(exception: AuthenticationException) {
       // Error
   }

   override fun onSuccess(credentials: Credentials) {
       // Use the credentials
   }
})
